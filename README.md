# CS465-fullstack
SNHU CS 465 fullstack development with MEAN

# Architecture

This project used the templating framework handlebars which lets you template individual HTML pages. It worked really well for getting a website up and running quick. I preferred the SPA which I created with Angular. This project used Mongodb because it is a noSQL database. These types of databases are well suited for unstructured documents which is what this project was. 

# Functionality

JSON which stands for javascript object notation is a format that is both machine and human readable. The data for this site is usually converted to JSON format. So it ties the backend to data to what is displayed on the front end. For the SPA, a lot of the features were refactored into components. For instance, the nav bar was refactored into its own component along with the trip card which wraps the contents of the trip into a card.  This allows us to reuse the different parts when needed. Like the trip card, it allows us to write one component that can wrap multiple trips. 

# Testing

Most of the testing done for this project was done using post man to test the different api endpoints. Some of the features would have required building out other features to see them displayed on the front end. So, it is more efficient to use something like post man to make sure the api endpoints that were set up are actually working. When adding security, this adds another layer that you have to deal with. You need a verified user so you can test that the security you implemented is working properly.  

# Reflection

In this course I have learned a lot. I had never used Angular before so It was fun learning how it worked. The biggest takeaway I have from this course is working with the backend. I knew a little backend before taking this course but Iâ€™ve learned so much from this project. Especially about api endpoints. Since I plan on looking for work as a full stack engineer or a front end engineer, this class has been invaluable to that end.
